# When to Use Google Cloud for AI/ML

_Last Updated: November 30, 2025_

Situations where GCP is particularly compelling:

- Heavy use of BigQuery and SQL‑first analytics feeding ML models.
- Need for tightly integrated, fully managed ML platform (Vertex AI) with strong GenAI capabilities.
- Event‑driven architectures that benefit from Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and Cloud Run.
- Hybrid or multi‑cloud strategies where BigQuery Omni or Anthos can add value.

When working with UK healthcare and regulated workloads, combine GCP’s security and compliance features with robust governance (IAM, VPC Service Controls, audit logging) and cross‑reference Azure offerings if clients are already Azure‑centred.
