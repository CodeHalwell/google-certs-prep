# Practice Questions – Generative AI Leader

_Last Updated: November 30, 2025_

Use the checkboxes to track progress. These are **non‑official** practice prompts inspired by the public exam description.

1. [ ] A healthcare provider wants to reduce clinician documentation burden while maintaining compliance. Which GenAI capabilities on Google Cloud are most appropriate, and what risks must be mitigated?
2. [ ] Your client wants to use the largest available model for all workloads. How would you explain the trade‑offs between cost, latency, and quality, and when a smaller model or RAG might be preferable?
3. [ ] An internal legal team is concerned about sending confidential documents to GenAI services. How can you architect a solution on GCP that addresses data residency, access control, and logging requirements?

Extend this list with your own scenario‑based questions, especially in healthcare and regulated domains.
