# Google Cloud AI Certifications

_Last Updated: November 30, 2025_

This repository is a curated, exam-aligned learning hub for three key Google Cloud certifications:

- **Google Cloud Generative AI Leader** – business and strategy focus
- **Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer** – advanced technical and MLOps focus
- **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer** – foundational GCP operations and infrastructure

It is specifically tailored for:

- Advanced Python and ML practitioners building **Vertex AI**, **RAG**, and **agentic** solutions
- UK-based professionals (all prices in **GBP**, UK-centric timelines)
- Google Developer Program members with **Google Cloud Skills Boost Premium** access

The goal is to give you a **single source of truth** for:

- Study plans and exam guides
- Hands-on labs (with explicit cleanup steps to avoid surprise bills)
- Python/TensorFlow/Vertex AI code examples you can run locally or in GCP
- Architecture patterns and MLOps best practices, especially for healthcare and regulated domains
- Cost optimisation guidance and realistic GBP study budgets

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Start with ACE (Months 1–2)**  
	Build solid GCP fundamentals using `associate-cloud-engineer/` and the ACE part of `study-plan.md`. Focus on core services, networking, IAM, and operations.

2. **Add business GenAI context (Month 3)**  
	Use `generative-ai-leader/` to learn how to position GenAI solutions for clients, especially in healthcare and other regulated sectors.

3. **Deep dive into ML and MLOps (Months 4–6)**  
	Use `professional-ml-engineer/` for hands-on ML on GCP, Vertex AI, TensorFlow, and full MLOps pipelines.

4. **Leverage Premium Access**  
	For each topic, check `premium-resources.md` and the relevant `hands-on-labs/` files for Skills Boost lab recommendations.

5. **Track Costs and Progress**  
	Use `shared-resources/cost-optimization.md` to keep practice environments affordable, and the checklists in each file to track progress.
