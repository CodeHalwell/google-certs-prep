_Last Updated: November 30, 2025_

**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Suggested duration:** 8–12 weeks (10–12 hours per week)

This schedule aligns to the 6‑month integrated plan in `../study-plan.md`.

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2) – ML on GCP & Foundations

- [ ] Read `learning-paths/01-ml-on-gcp.md`
- [ ] Complete foundational Skills Boost labs (data, ML, AI on GCP)
- [ ] Frame 3–5 ML problems from your consultancy and map to GCP services

## Phase 2 (Weeks 3–4) – Vertex AI Deep Dive

- [ ] Work through `learning-paths/02-vertex-ai.md`
- [ ] Run labs in `hands-on-labs/vertex-ai-labs.md`
- [ ] Deploy at least one custom model and one AutoML model

## Phase 3 (Weeks 5–6) – TensorFlow/Keras & Model Dev

- [ ] Study `learning-paths/03-tensorflow-keras.md`
- [ ] Build, train, and evaluate models using TensorFlow on GCP
- [ ] Capture reusable patterns in `code-examples/tensorflow-examples/`

## Phase 4 (Weeks 7–8) – MLOps & Optimisation

- [ ] Study `learning-paths/04-mlops-deployment.md` and `05-model-optimization.md`
- [ ] Implement a small CI/CD pipeline (Cloud Build + Cloud Run/GKE)
- [ ] Run hyperparameter tuning and monitoring experiments

## Phase 5 (Weeks 9–10+) – Responsible ML & Final Prep

- [ ] Study `learning-paths/06-responsible-ml.md`
- [ ] Work through advanced labs in `hands-on-labs/`
- [ ] Take timed practice exams in `practice-exam.md`
