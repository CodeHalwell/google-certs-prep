**Estimated time:** 6–10 hours

Map your Skills Boost premium labs here (names may change over time):

- [ ] "Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud"
- [ ] "Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI"

For each lab, record:

- Prerequisites (enabling APIs, minimum IAM roles, sample datasets)
- Key steps (what you actually build and deploy)
- Validation checks (how you know the lab worked)
- Cleanup tasks to avoid charges (delete endpoints, jobs, buckets where safe)
