## Recommended Premium Paths by Certification

### Associate Cloud Engineer

Focus on labs that reinforce:

- Project and billing setup
- IAM configuration
- Compute Engine, GKE, App Engine, Cloud Run deployments
- Networking (VPC, load balancing)
- Monitoring and logging

Map them to:

- `associate-cloud-engineer/hands-on-labs/README.md` for a structured checklist.
- Topic files under `associate-cloud-engineer/` for theory before/after each lab.

### Generative AI Leader

Look for:

- Generative AI learning paths and executive-focused GenAI courses
- Labs using Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Vertex AI Search and Conversation

Use them alongside:

- `generative-ai-leader/study-materials.md`
- `generative-ai-leader/business-use-cases.md`
- `generative-ai-leader/responsible-ai.md`

Capture takeaways in your own words, focusing on **business value**, **risk**, and **governance**.

### Professional Machine Learning Engineer

Prioritise:

- "Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud"
- "Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI"
- "Advanced ML on Google Cloud"
- "MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) Fundamentals"
- "Production Machine Learning Systems"

Tie these to:

- `professional-ml-engineer/learning-paths/` for the conceptual backbone
- `professional-ml-engineer/hands-on-labs/` for lab notes and cleanup steps
- `professional-ml-engineer/code-examples/` for your own extensions to lab code

## Strategy for Using Premium with This Repo

1. **Read → Lab → Reflect**  
	For each topic, skim the relevant markdown in this repo, then complete a Skills Boost lab, then write a short summary or “lesson learned” back into your notes.

2. **Track Lab-based Evidence**  
	Treat each completed lab as evidence you can solve a class of exam questions. Note which exam domain(s) it supports (especially for PMLE).

3. **Use Credits Intentionally**  
	Use `shared-resources/cost-optimization.md` to estimate costs before running long or GPU-heavy labs, and always follow cleanup instructions.

4. **Align Labs with Real Work**  
	Where possible, mirror your consultancy or healthcare projects inside labs: similar data shapes, deployment targets, or governance requirements.

> **Note:** Lab names and URLs change over time; always verify against your current Skills Boost catalogue.
